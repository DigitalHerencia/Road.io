- Inspection scheduling and records (DOT/state/custom) are managed with digital forms and photo documentation.
- Compliance tracking and audit trails are maintained.
- All changes are validated and persisted in the database.
- Unit and integration tests cover all logic and endpoints.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement UI for maintenance and inspection management.
- [ ] Create API endpoints for maintenance, inspection, and alert data.
- [ ] Implement backend logic for scheduling, tracking, alerts, and compliance.
