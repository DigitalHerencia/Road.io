# Issue 05: Implement Advanced Features (Fuel, Telematics, Document Management)

## Description
Develop advanced features for the Vehicles module, including fuel management (tracking, reporting, IFTA), telematics integration (GPS, diagnostics, predictive maintenance), and document management (vehicle docs, alerts, compliance).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Fuel tracking, efficiency monitoring, cost/mile, and card integration are implemented.
- Fuel reporting covers consumption, trends, cost, and IFTA data.
- Telematics integration supports GPS, diagnostics, idle time, geofencing, predictive maintenance.
- Document management includes registration, insurance, inspection, maintenance, title/lien, with alerts and compliance tracking.
- All changes are validated and persisted in the database.
- Unit and integration tests cover all logic and endpoints.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement UI for fuel, telematics, and document management.
- [ ] Create API endpoints for fuel, telematics, and document data.
- [ ] Implement backend logic for tracking, integration, and compliance.
- [ ] Add tests for all new logic and endpoints.

## Priority
Phase 2 (Enhanced Management)
