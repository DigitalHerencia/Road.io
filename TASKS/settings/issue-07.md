# Issue 07: Implement Performance Optimization and Maintenance (Settings Module)

## Description
Develop performance optimization and maintenance features for the Settings module, including caching strategies, database/query optimization, system monitoring, backup/recovery, and health checks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Settings caching (user, system, permission, integration) is implemented with cache invalidation.
- Database queries are optimized for retrieval and bulk updates; indexes and pooling are used.
- System monitoring covers configuration validation, integration status, performance, error tracking, alerts.
- Automated backup and recovery procedures are in place with version control and integrity checks.
- All features are validated, persisted, and tested.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement caching and optimization strategies.
- [ ] Optimize database schema and queries for settings.
- [ ] Implement system monitoring, health checks, and alerting.
- [ ] Develop backup and recovery automation.
- [ ] Add tests for all new logic and endpoints.

## Priority
Phase 3 (Advanced Features)
