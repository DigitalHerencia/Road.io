# Issue 03: Implement System Configuration Management (MVP)

## Description
Develop the system configuration management features for the Settings module, allowing administrators to control application-wide settings such as feature toggles, module availability, default permissions, maintenance windows, and backup configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Admins can view and update application settings (feature toggles, modules, permissions, maintenance, backups).
- Changes are validated and persisted in the database.
- System configuration is loaded at startup and on relevant changes.
- UI provides clear feedback and prevents invalid configurations.
- Unit and integration tests cover all logic and endpoints.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement UI for system configuration management.
- [ ] Create API endpoints for updating and retrieving system settings.
- [ ] Implement backend logic for validation and persistence.
- [ ] Integrate with permission system for admin-only access.
- [ ] Add tests for all new logic and endpoints.

## Priority
Phase 1 (Core MVP)
