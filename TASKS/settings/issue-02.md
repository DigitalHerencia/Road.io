# Issue 02: Implement User Preferences Management (MVP)

## Description
Develop the user preferences management features for the Settings module, enabling users to customize their personal settings, interface preferences, and regional settings. This should include UI components, backend logic, and database integration for storing and retrieving user-specific preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can update personal settings (display name, avatar, contact info, language, time zone, date/time formats).
- Users can set interface preferences (theme, dashboard layout, default views, notifications, accessibility).
- Users can configure regional settings (units, currency, number/address formats, compliance rules).
- Preferences are persisted in the database and loaded on login.
- All changes are validated and provide user feedback.
- Unit and integration tests cover all logic and endpoints.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement UI for user preferences (personal, interface, regional).
- [ ] Create API endpoints for updating and retrieving user preferences.
- [ ] Implement backend logic for validation and persistence.
- [ ] Integrate with authentication to load/save preferences per user.
- [ ] Add tests for all new logic and endpoints.

## Priority
