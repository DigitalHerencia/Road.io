# Issue 05: Implement Integration Management (MVP)

## Description
Develop the integration management features for the Settings module, enabling configuration of third-party APIs, service integrations (ELD, fuel cards, mapping, communication, payment), and data import/export. Include internal module connections and notification settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Admins can configure API keys, webhooks, rate limits, authentication, and monitor integration status.
- Service integrations (ELD, fuel, mapping, comms, payment) are configurable and status is visible.
- Data import/export supports CSV, mapping, scheduling, error handling, validation.
- Internal integrations support cross-module data sharing, workflow config, alert/report routing, sync.
- Notification settings for email, SMS, push, escalation, templates are manageable.
- All changes are validated, persisted, and tested.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement UI for integration and notification management.
- [ ] Create API endpoints for integration and notification configuration.
- [ ] Implement backend logic for validation, persistence, and monitoring.
- [ ] Integrate with internal modules for data sharing and workflow.
- [ ] Add tests for all new logic and endpoints.

## Priority
