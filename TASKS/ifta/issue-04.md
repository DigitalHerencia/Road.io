- Vehicle assignment and dispatch system integration are supported.
- All flows are tested and documented.

## References
- See `main/src/features/ifta/` for UI and logic.
- Use server actions for data import and integration.

## Checklist
- [ ] ELD integration and data synchronization
- [ ] Fleet management integration
- [ ] Vehicle assignment tracking
- [ ] Dispatch system integration
- [ ] Tests and documentation

## Verification
- Import ELD data, track vehicle assignments, and verify integration.
- Run all tests and lint/typecheck.
