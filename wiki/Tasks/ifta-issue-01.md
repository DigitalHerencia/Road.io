# IFTA Task 01: Implement Mileage Tracking (IFTA MVP)

## Description
Build mileage tracking features for the IFTA module. This includes manual trip entry, load association, jurisdiction tracking (state/province allocation, interstate/intrastate classification), and automatic mileage calculation (GPS-based, validation rules).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Manual trip entry interface and load association are available.
- Jurisdiction tracking and classification are implemented.
- GPS-based mileage calculation and validation rules are in place.
- All flows are tested and documented.

## References
- See `main/src/features/ifta/` for UI and logic.
- Use server actions for trip recording and mileage calculation.
- See [Development Standards](../Development-Standards.md) for architecture and validation.
- See [Official Docs](../Official-Docs.md) for GPS and data handling best practices.

## Checklist
- [ ] Manual trip entry and load association
- [ ] Jurisdiction tracking and classification
- [ ] GPS-based mileage calculation
- [ ] Mileage validation rules
- [ ] Tests and documentation

## Verification
- Enter trips, track mileage, and verify jurisdiction allocation and validation.
- Run all tests and lint/typecheck.

**LLM Agent Guidance:**
- Use feature-driven architecture and server actions for all mutations.
- Validate all trip and mileage data.
- Update documentation and wiki as needed.
