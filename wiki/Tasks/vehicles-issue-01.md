## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement UI for vehicle registration and profile management.
- [ ] Create API endpoints for creating, editing, and retrieving vehicle profiles.
- [ ] Implement backend logic for validation and persistence.
- [ ] Add tests for all new logic and endpoints.

## Priority
Phase 1 (Core MVP)
